# Introduction
Hello! My name is Nathan Dawson and I am a senior in highschool.

I am making a game for my senior project and I'll be working on it here.

## What kind of game:
I knew I could only handle 2D art and have never made a game before, but I finally decided on making a 2D platformer with  constantly growing player abilities/powers (rogue-like I believe) and hopefully, competitive multiplayer.

More details about functionality I'm working on is in the [Projects Tab](https://github.com/Mystical-ly/Game-Nights-And-Days-/projects?query=is%3Aopen)

## Updates:
In the [Releases Tab](https://github.com/Mystical-ly/Game-Nights-And-Days-/releases) I plan on uploading a playable version of what I've got so far with info on whats new, along with a video to show how developement is going
